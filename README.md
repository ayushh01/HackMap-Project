## INTRODUCTION:-
    - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, moving picture, theatrical film, or photoplay, is a series of still images that,       when shown on a screen, create the illusion of moving images.
    - This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed in rapid succession.        The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion-          picture camera, by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques, by means of CGI and          computer animation, or by a combination of some or all of these techniques, and other visual effects.
